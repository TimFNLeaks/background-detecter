# What is that?
A bot to generate the current Fortnite Lobby and Shop Background in only a few seconds!

# Usage
Run install.bat and wait until all packages are installed.
Now you can run run.bat. Wait a few seconds until you see two links. 
It should look like this:

If you open any link you should see the selected background! (copy the link and paste it in your browser)


The bot is also useful for updates since it tracks both backgrounds every single minute!
