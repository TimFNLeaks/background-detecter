# What is that?
A bot to generate the current Fortnite Lobby and Shop Background in only a few seconds!

# Usage
Run install.bat and wait until all packages are installed.
Now you can run run.bat. Wait a few seconds until you see two links. 
It should look like this:

If you click on any link you should see the named background!
The bot is also useful for updates since it tracks both backgrounds every single minute!
